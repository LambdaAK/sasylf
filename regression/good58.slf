terminals S Z

syntax
   n ::= Z 
      | S n

   0 := Z
   1 := S Z

judgment equality: n = n

    -------- eq
     n = n

theorem overly-complex:
   forall n
   exists n = n
   proof by induction on n:
     case 0 is // NPE
       proof by rule eq
     end case
     case S n' is
       e': n' = n' by induction hypothesis on n'
       proof by rule eq
     end case
  end induction
end theorem
