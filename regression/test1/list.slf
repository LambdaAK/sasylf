requires

abstract syntax e

judgment eeq: e = e

  ----- eeq
  e = e

provides

terminals nil
syntax l ::= nil | e, l

judgment append: l @ l = l

  ----------- append-nil
  nil @ l = l

  l1 @ l2 = l3
  -------------------- append-cons
  (e,l1) @ l2 = (e, l3)
  

theorem append-total:
	forall l1
	forall l2
	exists l1 @ l2 = l3
	proof by induction on l1:
		case nil is
			proof by rule append-nil
		end case
		case (e, l1') is
			a': l1' @ l2 = l3' by induction hypothesis on l1', l2
			proof by rule append-cons on a'
		end case
	end induction
end theorem
